While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,\\nhigh API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing\\ncontext pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for\\ngeneral text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to\\nsuboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose\\nLongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed\\nspecifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)\\ncoarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks\\nusing conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only\\nthe most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments\\nretained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal\\nsubset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across\\nmultiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question\\nanswering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,\\nachieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By\\neffectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,\\nLongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code\\nscenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence\\napplications.&quot;,&quot;upvotes&quot;:81,&quot;discussionId&quot;:&quot;68ddef316024653e8a3ed0ee&quot;,&quot;githubRepo&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/YerbaPage/LongCodeZip&quot;,&quot;ai_summary&quot;:&quot;LongCodeZip

However, their reliance on transformer\\narchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when\\nextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive\\nformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from\\nshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models\\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we\\npropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in\\nlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video\\nteachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on\\nexploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the\\nstudent model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.\\nOur method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to\\n20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure\\nand error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous\\nmethods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of\\ngenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the\\nmaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x\\nlonger than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and\\nour proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially\\noutperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

However, standard\\non-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading\\nto computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has\\nhighlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience\\ncharacteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains\\nunderexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a\\nreasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as\\neffective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose\\nExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that\\norganizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy\\nobjective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on\\nfive backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently\\nimproves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an\\naverage gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO\\nstabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods\\nfail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key\\ningredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.&quot;,&quot;upvotes&quot;:59,&quot;discussionId&quot;:&quot;68df3b52df49fb0df1e03cda&quot;,&quot;githubRepo&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/ElliottYan/LUFFY/tree/main/ExGRPO&quot;,&quot;ai_summary&quot;:&quot;ExGRPO,

While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.\\n&quot;,&quot;updatedAt&quot;:&quot;2025-10-03T02:08:58.125Z&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;taesiri&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;taesiri&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:true,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:118}},&quot;numEdits&quot;:0,&quot;identifiedLanguage&quot;:{&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;probability&quot;:0.9109583497047424},&quot;editors&quot;:[&quot;taesiri&quot;],&quot;editorAvatarUrls&quot;:[&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg&quot;],&quot;reactions&quot;:[{&quot;reaction&quot;:&quot;🤗&quot;,&quot;users&quot;:[&quot;TranSirius&quot;,&quot;RicardoL1u&quot;,&quot;JK-TK&quot;,&quot;Sharif19&quot;],&quot;count&quot;:4}],&quot;isReport&quot;:false}},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;68e079adcb032d78f068078d&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;63d3e0e8ff1384ce6c5dd17d&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1674830754237-63d3e0e8ff1384ce6c5dd17d.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Librarian Bot (Bot)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;librarian-bot&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:267},&quot;createdAt&quot;:&quot;2025-10-04T01:34:37.000Z&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;comment&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;edited&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;latest&quot;:{&quot;raw&quot;:&quot;This is an automated message from the [Librarian Bot](https://huggingface.co/librarian-bots).

These models are typically built by finetuning large vision-language decoders (VLMs) with contrastive losses on text-image pairs. In this work, we show that, while cost-efficient, this repurposing approach often bottlenecks retrieval performance. Through controlled experiments, we establish a principled recipe for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms models up to 10 times larger when finetuned on document retrieval tasks.

That split means the base model never practices “thinking before predicting” while it’s learning from raw text. We asked: what if exploration happened during pretraining itself, and we rewarded thoughts that genuinely help predict the next token—without any task‑specific verifiers?\\nWhat we built.RLP is a pretraining objective that treats a short chain‑of‑thought (CoT) as an action taken before predicting each token.\\n\\nFor each position, the model samples a brief thought, then scores the true next token twice:\\n\\nwith the thought, and 2) with a “no‑think” baseline (a slowly updated EMA teacher).\\n\\n\\nThe reward is the increase in the model’s log‑likelihood of the observed next token with the thought compared to without it.\\n\\nWe update only the thought tokens using a clipped, group‑relative advantage objective; we do not backprop through the reward scores.\\n\\nThe signal is dense (every position gets a reward), verifier‑free (works on ordinary text), and scales to full documents (no entropy filtering or curated checkers).\\n\\n\\nWhy earlier approaches (e.g., RPT) fell short.Prior “reinforcement pretraining” with prefix‑matching rewards (RPT) usually relies on:\\n\\nSparse, binary rewards tied to next‑token correctness that ignore the content of the thought,\\nAuxiliary entropy filters to pick a subset of tokens to train on, and\\nExperiments on distilled checkpoints, leaving open whether it helps base models.RLP instead delivers a continuous, per‑token improvement signal, trains on all tokens in full documents, needs no side model or heuristics, and is explicitly designed to shape base‑model thinking early.\\n\\nKey results.\\n\\nQwen3‑1.7B, base pretraining:\\n\\nOverall average across our math‑and‑science suite improves by about 19% vs. the base model (36.03 vs. 30.32) and about 17% vs. continuous pretraining on the same tokens (36.03 vs. 30.85).\\nUnder compute matching, we gave the CPT baseline 35× more tokens to equalize FLOPs; RLP still leads on the same setup by +5.32 points overall on the NC corpus (43.36 vs. 38.04).\\nVersus RPT with matched data/compute, RLP improves Overall Avg by +1.66 points (about +4% relative) and also leads on Math and Science aggregates.\\n\\n\\nAfter identical post‑training (SFT + RLVR) for all models:\\n\\nGains compound: RLP+Post 42.51 vs. Base+Post 39.34 (about +8% relative) and vs. CPT+Post 39.90 (about +6.5% relative).\\nThe biggest lifts are on reasoning‑heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU‑Pro.\\n\\n\\nScaling to a 12B hybrid (NeMo‑12B):\\n\\nApplying only 250M RLP tokens to an intermediate checkpoint boosts the overall average from 42.81 to 61.32 (+18.51 points; about +43% relative).\\nScience Avg rises from 34.51 to 57.26 (about +23 points), showing strong cross‑domain transfer, not just math‑specific gains.\\n\\n\\nDomain breadth and data practicality:\\n\\nRLP works on SFT‑style reasoning corpora and general pretraining sources (academic papers, textbooks, web QA).\\nImprovements persist even when the baseline sees vastly more tokens to match FLOPs, indicating the benefits come from the objective rather than from a larger data budget.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn short, RLP rewards “useful thoughts” during pretraining. The signal is simple, dense, verifier‑free, and compatible with standard pipelines—yielding stronger base models whose gains survive and compound after alignment.\\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01265Code: https://github.com/NVlabs/RLP\\n&quot;,&quot;updatedAt&quot;:&quot;2025-10-03T02:25:02.436Z&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;64414b62603214724ebd2636&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64414b62603214724ebd2636/x9JVcJRZKZE7hdEII1JRR.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Ali&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ahatamiz&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:4}},&quot;numEdits&quot;:0,&quot;identifiedLanguage&quot;:{&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;probability&quot;:0.8267005681991577},&quot;editors&quot;:[&quot;ahatamiz&quot;],&quot;editorAvatarUrls&quot;:[&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64414b62603214724ebd2636/x9JVcJRZKZE7hdEII1JRR.jpeg&quot;],&quot;reactions&quot;:[{&quot;reaction&quot;:&quot;❤️&quot;,&quot;users&quot;:[&quot;SieraL&quot;],&quot;count&quot;:1}],&quot;isReport&quot;:false}},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;68e07972462eb02f83342642&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;63d3e0e8ff1384ce6c5dd17d&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1674830754237-63d3e0e8ff1384ce6c5dd17d.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Librarian Bot (Bot)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;librarian-bot&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:267},&quot;createdAt&quot;:&quot;2025-10-04T01:33:38.000Z&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;comment&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;edited&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;latest&quot;:{&quot;raw&quot;:&quot;This is an automated message from the [Librarian Bot](https://huggingface.co/librarian-bots).

In this paper, we present\\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\\npredicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the\\nmodel to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an\\nindependent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the\\nreward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when\\nconditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to\\nconditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense\\nreward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream\\nduring pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for\\nreasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between\\nnext-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.\\nPretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an\\neight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,\\nthe gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such\\nas AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2\\nincreases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on\\nscientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and\\nmodel

Previous methods either rely on text-level information\\n(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,\\nor on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on\\nless-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial\\nprojections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden\\nstates. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical\\nfeatures that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly\\nalign with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper\\nexplores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We\\nshow that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable\\nsignature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we\\npresent Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately\\nminimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only\\nsummarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies\\ncorrectness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''\\nclusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights\\nthe strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently\\noutperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern\\nconfidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and\\nmajority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24\\nwith a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to

It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and\\npotentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:\\nsteering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply\\nwith harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model\\nfamilies, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the\\nprobability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign\\nfeatures from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable\\ndirections, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that\\ncombining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a\\nuniversal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen\\nrequests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through\\ninterpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not\\nguarantee precise control over model behavior.&quot;,&quot;upvotes&quot;:20,&quot;discussionId&quot;:&quot;68dec5ae70ada21878c7516f&quot;,&quot;ai_summary&quot;:&quot;Activation steering, intended to control LLM behavior, can instead increase harmful compliance and undermine model alignment safeguards.&quot;,&quot;ai_keywords&quot;:[&quot;activation steering&quot;,&quot;LLM behavior&quot;,&quot;semantically meaningful vectors&quot;,&quot;hidden states&quot;,&quot;model alignment safeguards&quot;,&quot;harmful requests&quot;,&quot;sparse autoencoder&quot;,&quot;universal attack&quot;]},&quot;canReadDatabase&quot;:false,&quot;canManagePapers&quot;:false,&quot;canSubmit&quot;:false,&quot;hasHfLevelAccess&quot;:false,&quot;upvoted&quot;:false,&quot;upvoters&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;60cd95ee15ecba5f2200304a&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/60cd95ee15ecba5f2200304a/3gMYeWm8wQO5KfqE5RmEe.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Alexey Dontsov&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;therem&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;654621f45cd5692b3a9d08cb&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/noauth/NJj1FJyYHNPRXb0QBXjv-.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Mikhail Seleznyov&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;myyycroft&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;662f8d645c4db70c77a203b0&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/72f9a3c39b3ba5114388d16a35524835.svg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Elena Tutubalina&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;tlenusik&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;65eed1f64f8aa96f64ff229e&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/65eed1f64f8aa96f64ff229e/r71vIJ1OGSo-6a3BspEgG.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Mikhail Chaichuk&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;THunderCondOR&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;682ccb1c94ed89a9b287306d&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/71cfa251e80f418b0bfeeab06b47e5ad.svg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Sedyakina&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;sedyakinad&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;661e44cf1d8ffc49b57ba07e&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/3e937cc4f784b369b9f996ba82d1b81d.svg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Andrey Galichin&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;andreuka18&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;67ce16574cc40026ba95e1e0&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/83f7d8982278fc03d500e37ffaef5d82.svg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Andrei Sakhovskii&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;Boolalg&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;64b2cf7f4e5902e2fdc1f17d&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64b2cf7f4e5902e2fdc1f17d/3b_9W5uVz-ulzI9oRMj4p.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;composite&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;composite&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;6453df2b908e259483c12bdb&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6453df2b908e259483c12bdb/j0QZDDWffeZNiTMEgQTtS.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Oleg Y.
