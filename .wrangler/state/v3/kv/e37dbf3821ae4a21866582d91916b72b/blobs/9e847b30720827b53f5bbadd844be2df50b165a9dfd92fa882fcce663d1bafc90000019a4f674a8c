However, prior studies often assume fixed collaboration architectures (e.g., topologies) and single-model usage, overlooking that optimal architectures and model combinations can vary across tasks. Therefore, we study the novel problem of searching for compute-optimal model combinations and architectures in TTS under a fixed budget. We formalize it as a multi-LLM collaboration graph, where nodes encode roles and LLM model assignments, and edges capture information flow. This problem is challenging because (i) the combinatorial search space is prohibitively large, and (ii) task-specific requirements demand tailored designs. To address these, we reformulate the problem as probabilistic graph optimization and, through pilot experiments, derive three empirical insights into TTS collaboration graphs. Guided by these insights, we propose Agent-REINFORCE, an LLM-agent-augmented framework that mirrors the REINFORCE pipeline by mapping sampling-gradient-update to sampling-feedback-update, where feedback serves as a textual gradient to update the probabilistic graph and efficiently search for optimal multi-LLM collaboration graphs.

However, current generative models still struggle with handling diverse and complex image editing tasks that require implicit reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess their performance across various reasoning scenarios.

However, prevailing evaluations treat these abilities in isolation, such that tasks with multimodal inputs and outputs are scored primarily through unimodal reasoning, i.e., textual benchmarks emphasize language-based reasoning, while visual benchmarks emphasize reasoning outcomes manifested in the pixels. We introduce ROVER to address this pressing need to test reciprocal cross-modal reasoning, the use of one modality to guide, verify, or refine outputs in the other, an ability central to the vision of unified multimodal intelligence. ROVER is a human-annotated benchmark that explicitly targets reciprocal cross-modal reasoning, which contains 1312 tasks grounded in 1876 images, spanning two complementary settings. Verbally-augmented reasoning for visual generation evaluates whether models can use verbal prompts and reasoning chains to guide faithful image synthesis. Visually-augmented reasoning for verbal generation evaluates whether models can generate intermediate visualizations that strengthen their own reasoning processes for question answering. Experiments on 17 unified models reveal two key findings: (i) Cross-modal reasoning determines visual generation quality, with interleaved models significantly outperforming non-interleaved ones; notably, combining strong unimodal models fails to achieve comparable reasoning. (ii) Models show dissociation between physical and symbolic reasoning: they succeed at interpreting perceptual concepts literally but fail to construct visual ions for symbolic tasks, where faulty reasoning harms performance.

Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are\nmostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing\nefforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to\nreplicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we\nintroduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,\nrealized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed\nnetwork of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to\nintelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing\nstates that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating\nrich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly\ntransition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances\ngeneralization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and\nscales (up to 10$\\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities\nsuch as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,\neasy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with\nintegrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels\nof dexterity in robotic manipulation.","published":"2025-10-31T17:34:04Z","source":"arxiv","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27666v1","analysis":{"introduction":"🚀 What if a robotic gripper could reconfigure its whole body like an octopus to pick tiny screws and big bottles with the same hand?
