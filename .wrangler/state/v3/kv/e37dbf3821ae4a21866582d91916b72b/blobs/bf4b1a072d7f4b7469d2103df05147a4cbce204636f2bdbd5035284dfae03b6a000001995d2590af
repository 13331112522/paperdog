We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute\nas Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time\ninto reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group\nof parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current\npolicy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy)\nreconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra\ninference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two\nregimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers;\n(ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria\nscored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction\nsatisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge\nscores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all\nrollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a\ntest-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up\nto +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning\n(CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained\npolicy surpassing the initial teacher signal.","authors":["Dulhan Jayalath","Shashwat Goel","Thomas Foster","Parag Jain","Suchin Gururangan","Cheng Zhang","Anirudh Goyal","Alan Schelten"],"published":"2025-09-17T17:59:42Z","updated":"2025-09-17T17:59:42Z","category":"","source":"arxiv","original_source":"arxiv","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14234v1","pdf_url":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14234v1.pdf","scraped_at":"2025-09-18T13:56:00.944Z","analysis":{"introduction":"The paper addresses the challenge of generating learning signals in scenarios where ground truth is unavailable during post-training.
