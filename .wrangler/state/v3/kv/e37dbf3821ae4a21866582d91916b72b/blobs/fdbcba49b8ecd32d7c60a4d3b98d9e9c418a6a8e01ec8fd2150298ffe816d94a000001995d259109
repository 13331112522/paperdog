We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute\nas Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time\ninto reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group\nof parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current\npolicy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy)\nreconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra\ninference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two\nregimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers;\n(ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria\nscored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction\nsatisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge\nscores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all\nrollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a\ntest-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up\nto +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning\n(CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained\npolicy surpassing the initial teacher signal.","published":"2025-09-17T17:59:42Z","source":"arxiv","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14234v1","analysis":{"introduction":"The paper addresses the challenge of generating learning signals in scenarios where ground truth is unavailable during post-training. The authors introduce the Compute as Teacher (CaT) framework, which leverages the model's own inference-time exploration to create reference-free supervision. This approach is motivated by the need for effective learning mechanisms in reinforcement learning and other AI applications where traditional supervision is not feasible.","challenges":"A key challenge is how to derive meaningful supervision signals from a model's own explorations without relying on ground truth. Existing methods often depend on selection strategies that may not capture the correct answer when all outputs are incorrect. Additionally, the need for scalable and efficient computation during inference poses limitations for real-time applications.","innovations":"The CaT framework synthesizes a reference from multiple parallel rollouts of the model's policy, allowing it to generate supervision signals without external references. This method reconciles discrepancies among rollouts using a frozen anchor policy, enhancing the robustness of the learning signal.

When combined with reinforcement learning (CaT-RL), further gains of up to +33% and +30% were observed, indicating that the trained policy outperformed the initial teacher signal. Comparisons with baseline methods highlighted the effectiveness of the synthesis approach over traditional selection methods.","insights":"The findings suggest that leveraging inference-time compute for generating supervision can significantly enhance model performance, particularly in environments lacking ground truth. This approach has implications for various applications in AI, including autonomous systems and interactive learning environments. Future research could explore the scalability of CaT in more complex tasks and its integration with other learning paradigms.","keywords":["Compute as Teacher","reference-free supervision","reinforcement learning","parallel rollouts","self-proposed rubrics","verifiable tasks","non-verifiable tasks","LLM judge"],"category":"machine_learning","relevance_score":9,"technical_depth":"advanced","summary":"**Introduction:** The paper addresses the challenge of generating learning signals in scenarios where ground truth is unavailable during post-training.
