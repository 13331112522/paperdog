## 🎯 AI Agent Integration Examples

### Claude Desktop
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paperdog": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": ["-X", "POST", "https://paperdog.org/mcp", "-H", "Content-Type: application/json", "-d", "@-"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Sample Conversation
> **User**: "I'm researching transformer architectures for computer vision. Can you help me find relevant papers?"
>
> **Claude**: [Uses `paperdog_search_papers` tool] "I found several relevant papers. Here are the top 5 recent papers on transformer architectures in computer vision..."
>
> **User**: "Get detailed analysis of the first paper"
>
> **Claude**: [Uses `paperdog_get_paper_details` tool] "Here's the comprehensive analysis of that paper, including the core innovations, experimental results, and future research directions..."
