      "args": ["-X", "POST", "https://paperdog.org/mcp", "-H", "Content-Type: application/json", "-d", "@-"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Sample Conversation
> **User**: "I'm researching transformer architectures for computer vision. Can you help me find relevant papers?"
>
> **Claude**: [Uses `paperdog_search_papers` tool] "I found several relevant papers. Here are the top 5 recent papers on transformer architectures in computer vision..."
>
> **User**: "Get detailed analysis of the first paper"
>
> **Claude**: [Uses `paperdog_get_paper_details` tool] "Here's the comprehensive analysis of that paper, including the core innovations, experimental results, and future research directions..."

## 🔧 Claude Code Integration Enhancement (October 2025)

### Recent Improvements
- **Enhanced MCP Configuration**: Added intelligent `paperdog-cli` server with automatic API fix
- **Daily Papers Fix**: Resolved `paperdog_get_daily_papers` historical date access issue
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic conversion to archive API when daily papers fails
- **Improved Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md and README.md with comprehensive MCP guides
- **Environment Variables**: Added helpful configuration variables for timeout and base URL

### Technical Fix Details
**Problem**: `paperdog_get_daily_papers` returned "No papers found for this date" for historical dates
